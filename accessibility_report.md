## Principle of Universal Design

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
Our software provides stock information without requiring a login,
promoting equitable access for all users. To enhance accessibility,
we plan to introduce customizable text sizes and color schemes.
These improvements will cater to users with visual impairments,
further supporting equitable use.

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Our software provides multiple methods to access stock pages,
such as search functions and bookmarks, ensuring flexibility for
different user preferences. Confirmation pop-ups help prevent errors,
enhancing user control and adaptability. To further improve this
principle, we could introduce voice command options to accommodate
diverse user interactions.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
Our software features a minimalist UI design, primarily using black
and white color schemes to reduce visual clutter and enhance usability.
All functionalities are presented intuitively, making it
straightforward for users to navigate and use the program. To
further support this principle, future updates could include a help
section with guided tutorials for new users.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
Information within our software is conveyed through clear visual
cues, such as distinct indicators for stock price fluctuations,
which are directly available on the homepage. Users can easily
view data for stocks in their watchlist, enhancing the immediacy
and clarity of important information.

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
Our software minimizes user errors by incorporating confirmation
pop-ups during logout, preventing accidental sign-outs. Additionally,
attempting to access portfolio or watchlist features without being
logged in triggers a prompt that reminds users to log in,
safeguarding against unauthorized access.

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
Our software is designed for efficiency, allowing users to operate
it with minimal physical effort. All features are easily accessible,
ensuring that users can navigate through the application and access
various functionalities conveniently and quickly, reducing the
strain and increasing the usability.

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Currently, our software does not specifically address this principle,
as it does not involve physical interaction. However, it is
designed to be used on various devices with differing screen sizes,
ensuring that users can access and interact with the software
comfortably from any device.


## Marketing Toward Specific User Demographics
Our stock trading simulation software is primarily targeted at
young adults and college students who are interested in learning
about the stock market without financial risk. This demographic
is generally tech-savvy and looks for educational tools that are
both informative and engaging. Marketing efforts would focus on
digital platforms popular among young adults, such as social media
channels and educational websites, with promotions highlighting
the software's educational value and simulation features.


## Accessibility and User Demographics
Our software is designed with simplicity in mind, making it
accessible to a broad user base. However, a potential challenge
for some users, particularly the elderly and those who are not
familiar with stock market data, might be understanding the
detailed data provided. To address this, we are considering
implementing features that would convert complex data into more
digestible visual formats, such as charts or graphs. This
enhancement would help in making the information more user-friendly
and easier to understand for all users, especially those who may
benefit from visual aids.
